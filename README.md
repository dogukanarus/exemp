Exemp is a finding job or employment project.
Not all people have the same opportunities to work. To give an example, when a student wants to earn money in the remaining time from his studies, he has difficulty in finding a suitable job. When housewives want to earn money, they cannot easily find a working condition for them. 
This is where Exemp comes into play. Our aim is to enable people from all walks of life to find the jobs that suit them in the easiest way, without difficulty, and to offer them a reliable platform.
We want to provide work force as much as possible to freelancers, those who need additional income, housewives, students, those who need daily-short-term work, or people with disabilities through our system. In addition, our system will be a reliable platform for people who are looking for a regular full-time job.
